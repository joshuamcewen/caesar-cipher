### Building Executable
1. Run `go build main.go`

### Running Executable
I've committed an executable `main`, should you want to run without installing Go and building.

1. Execute `./main`
2. See contents of `rtkfgCpfRtglwfkeg.txt`
3. Executable includes a timer which outputs execution time.

### Running Tests
1. Run `go test`

### Running Benchmarks
As well as referring to the execution time from stdout, you can benchmark via the tests.

1. Run `go test -bench=.`
